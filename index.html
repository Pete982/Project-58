        <h1> Hi! My name is Joseph Estridge! Today I'm going to tell you about my favorite hobby, which is doing coding. </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> My hobby is doing coding on free time. Whenever I get back home from my school I like to code and investigate and learn new things about coding, I do this after completing my homework. I am 11 years old and are in fifth grade going to sixth grade and my colmination day is June second zoom and June eighth in-person. June eighth will be the last day of school for me until summer. Now I know very well coding is a great thing to do that can make me complete. This habit can be developed to anyone however I got this naturally. Coding can keep anyone always happy and busy. It is a good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplended, loyal, punctual and most importantly and sucessful person in life. </p>
